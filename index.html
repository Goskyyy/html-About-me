    <h1>About me.</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        My name is <b>Abonyi Ogochukwu Doris</b>, A registered dietitian from
        the University of Nigeria Nsukka, I am also a fashion designer with love
        for everything fashion,my hobbies are singing,reading novels and
        travelling. I am currently enrolled in
        <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/">Altschoolafrica</a> for a one
        year course on frontend engineering with student
        <b>ID number(ALT/SOE/023/3690)</b>,I go by the name
        <a href="https://x.com/mhizogoo?s=11"> @mhizogoo </a> on X(formerly
        known as Twitter), I have loved tech for a very long time even as far
        back as secondary school but i never really got the opportunity to learn
        until I stumbled upon Altschoolafrica on twitter, the sense of community
        and excellence was what drew me to them, it was as if anyone who
        attended the school was already earmarked for excellence, and I really
        wanted that for myself. <br />
        I decided to sign up and I haven't regretted the decision till date, I
        have been able to garner a large level of knowledege as their teachings
        are so indepth and beginner friendly, I am very happy I made that
        decision because i know its only upwards from here.
      </p>
      <h2>My aim for joining Altschool</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Altschool because of the sense of community and excellence I
        saw in their students, prior to joining Altschool,i attempted to learn
        from online videos but I found out it wasnt structured and i was not
        getting the amount of support and motivation I needed, hence I needed a
        community of tech savvy individuals with in-depth knowledge on what tech
        was all about and I also needed to create meaningful frienships where we
        would all help and motivate each other towards achieving our various
        goals and I found all of that at Altschool.
      </p>
      <h2>My goal in Altschool.</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to joining Altschool,I knew I had to improve myself and become a
        renowned world class software engineer, and I believe I am on the right
        part and heading swiftly towards achieving my goal.
